# CanIRun - Steam Game Compatibility Checker

**CanIRun** is a Python tool that checks if your PC meets the minimum requirements to run a specific Steam game.

## Features

- Fetches minimum requirements for any Steam game by its AppID.
- Detects your system's storage, CPU frequency, GPU memory, and RAM.
- Compares your hardware with the game's requirements.
- Displays a detailed, color-coded report with pass/fail status and performance bars.
- Offers upgrade recommendations and gaming tips.

## How It Works

1. Enter the Steam AppID of the game you want to check.
2. The tool retrieves the game's minimum requirements from the Steam API.
3. Your system's hardware is automatically detected.
4. The results are displayed in a user-friendly format, showing which components pass or fail.
